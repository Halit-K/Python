    "An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day. It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.\n",

    "The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:\n",
    "The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.\n",
    "This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years.\n",
